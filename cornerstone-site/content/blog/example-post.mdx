Welcome to the **Cornerstone AI** blog. We are excited to share our thoughts on the future of business operations.

## Reimagining Capacity

AI is no longer just a buzzword; it's a fundamental shift in how work gets done. By implementing intelligent automation, firms are unlocking unprecedented levels of capacity.

> "Automation is not about replacing people. It's about elevating them to do the work that truly matters."

### The Power of Glassmorphism

You might notice our sleek new blog design. We've combined modern Markdown with custom React components and tailwind CSS.

Here is some inline code: `const capacity = AI + People;`

And a block of code demonstrating our tech stack:

```typescript
import { Automation } from '@cornerstone/ai';

const workflow = new Automation({
  target: 'Founder-Led Business',
  goal: 'Maximize Margins',
});

workflow.execute();
```

### Next Steps

We will continue to post updates here. Thanks for reading.
