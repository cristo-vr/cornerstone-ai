# Cornerstone AI — The Operations Accelerator for Founder-Led Businesses

Cornerstone AI builds operational infrastructure for founder-led businesses with 10–50 team members. We automate the three pillars every growing company runs on: Acquisition, Service & Retention, and Visibility.

Our done-for-you service replaces manual workflows, spreadsheets, and admin bottlenecks with automated systems — built on the tools your team already uses. No new software to learn. No disruption to daily work.

Founders typically recover 20+ hours per week of operational overhead. Margins expand because growth no longer requires proportional admin headcount. The founder gets visibility, control, and freedom back.
